The DESTM32L board is no longer available, and support for DESTM32L in this library is in conflict with DESTM32-T.

To compile for DESTM32L you would need to copy extras/deprecated/src/GxDESTM32L to src/GxDESTM32L.
And remove conflicting sources from src.

The example is in extras/deprecated/examples/GxEPD_HD_DESTM32L_Example.
